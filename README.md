# GitHub Browser

A ReactJS app to browse GitHub users using the GitHub API.

## Motivation

I have decided to learn React and took an online course about it. Then I finished it, and created this app to practice the basic concepts of React library.

So, this was my very first React app ðŸ˜€.

## Functionalities

- search user by GitHub username/login
- if the user was found, it shows:
    - user basic informarion, such as name, company and location.
    - list of user repositories
    - list of user starred repositories
